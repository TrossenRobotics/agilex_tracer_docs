The AgileX Robotics TRACER high-speed shuttle AGV is a great solution for indoor autonomous
logistics and warehousing applications. The two-wheel differential drive powered by two 150W
brushless servo motors allows TRACER to carry a payload of 100kg for up to 4 hours. TRACER's
independent rocker arm independent suspension gives it the ability to traverse obstacles as tall as
10mm and slopes as steep as 8Â° with a minimum ground clearance of 30mm. With its ability to rotate
in place, its low profile, and its steel body, TRACER is a great solution for your logistics
platform needs. The flat design of the body provides a huge payload capacity. The two-wheel drive
puts the universal wheels in motion, which can perform differential rotation and freely shuttle in
the indoor environment. It is additionally equipped with swing arm independent suspension which
leads to easy surmounting of small obstacles. Open-source packages are available for C++ and ROS
for secondary development.
